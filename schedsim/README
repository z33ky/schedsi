The schedsim file format consists of parenthesized tuples. Many of these are used in key-value style, where value can be a singular value, a tuple or nothing.
There are two types of values: String and Symbols.
Strings are sequences of printable characters (except `"`) surrounded by `"`.
Symbols are also character sequences. There are four types of Symbols: identifier, integer, decimal and fraction.
Identifier Symbols start with a letter or an underscore and continue with any number of letters, digits or underscores.
Integer Symbols are simply sequences of digits, possibly preceded by a `+` or `-`.
Decimal Symbols are similar, except they include a `.`, the decimal separator. Leaving out digits on either side is permitted, but not both, so `.`, `+.` and `-.` are not valid Symbols, while `0.` and `.0` are.
Fraction Symbols are Symbols with a `/`, the numerator on the left and the denominator on the right side of the character. The numerator and denominator must be valid Integer Symbols by themselves. A zero denominator will parse, but likely raise an Exception when it is interpreted.
A `;` starts a comment that extends to the end of line where it occurs, except in a String, in which case it is part of the String's contents and serves no special purpose. The Parser simply ignores comments.
The following are examples of valid tuples:
```
; this is a comment
(Key 42) ; a comment may also be placed here
(ComplicatedValues
    ; and a comment can also be placed here; this closing parenthesis will be ignored: )
    (SubExpression (1/4 0.5 1 2 4 8))
    "with a string"
)
("string key with empty tuple" ())
(5) ; as we don't require key-value style tuples, this is fine also
```
The root elements must be tuples.

Schedsim simulations only define a single simulation, hence can only have a single root element.
The root element should be a tuple with `Simulation` as key.
The simulation has 4 parameters: `log` to specify a log, `local_timer` to specify whether to enable the local timer scheduling mechanism, `time_limit` to set a time-limit for the simulation and the kernel, which is simply a tuple with `Module` as key.
The `Module` tuple declares a module. It requires specification of a scheduler and may have any number of threads and child-modules.
Available parameters can be obtained from the schedsi documentation.
Exemplary schedsim files can be found in the `examples/` directory.
